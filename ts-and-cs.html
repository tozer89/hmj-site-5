        <p class="muted">HMJ Global • Home • Bookkeeping Services • VAT Returns • Management Accounts • Recruitment Services • More</p>
        <p>These terms apply to all clients engaging with HMJ Finance for bookkeeping, accounting support, and related services. By working with us, you agree to the terms outlined below.</p>

      <div class="container grid cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>1. Our Commitment to You</h3>
          <p>At HMJ Finance, we are committed to providing dependable, professional bookkeeping and accounting support tailored to small businesses. We take pride in delivering services with accuracy, transparency, and respect for your time and data. We aim to build long-term partnerships based on trust, clear communication, and mutual success.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>2. Pricing &amp; Invoicing</h3>
          <p>All services provided by HMJ Finance are subject to the pricing structure agreed at the point of engagement. Pricing is based on the selected service package, or quoted separately for ad hoc and one-off work.</p>
          <p><strong>Standard Invoicing</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clients on monthly packages are invoiced in advance, typically on the 1st of each month.</li>
            <li>Invoices for project work or one-off support are issued either at the start or upon completion of the task, depending on the nature and scope of the work.</li>
            <li>All invoices will be issued via QuickBooks Online, and can be paid directly through the secure payment link provided, or via bank transfer (details included on the invoice).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>3. Payment Terms</h3>
          <p>Our standard payment term is 30 calendar days from the invoice date. However, we encourage early settlement by offering a 5% discount if full payment is received within 14 days.</p>
          <p>This discount will be applied automatically to your next invoice, or reflected as a credit balance where appropriate.</p>
          <p>Please note:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Overdue invoices may incur interest charges or administrative follow-up fees.</li>
            <li>Continued non-payment may result in paused services or cancellation of the agreement.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>4. Preferred Payment Methods</h3>
          <p>We accept payment through the following methods:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bank Transfer – Account details provided on every invoice</li>
            <li>QuickBooks Online Pay Now Link – Secure online card payment</li>
          </ul>
          <p>At this time, we do not accept payments via PayPal, cheque, or cash.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>5. Deposit for Larger Projects</h3>
          <p>For any project-based or one-off work expected to exceed 5 hours, we require a 25% deposit upfront to secure the time allocation. The remaining balance is invoiced upon completion of the work, unless otherwise agreed.</p>
          <p>This applies to services such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>VAT backlog clean-ups</li>
            <li>Historical reconciliations</li>
            <li>Custom dashboard/report builds</li>
            <li>Audit preparation</li>
            <li>Finance system clean-ups</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Quotes will always be provided in writing before work begins. Final invoices will reflect actual time worked and scope delivered.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>6. Package Flexibility &amp; Transaction Limits</h3>
          <p>All monthly service packages include a set transaction volume (e.g. 100, 250, 500, etc.). Should this limit be exceeded in any billing period, additional transactions will be billed at the agreed flexible rate per transaction (outlined in your proposal or package document).</p>
          <p>You will always be notified if you are nearing your transaction threshold.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>7. Service Pause or Cancellation</h3>
          <p>We understand that business needs can change. You may pause or cancel your service package at any time by giving 14 days’ written notice via email.</p>
          <p>Upon cancellation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Any remaining services for that billing cycle will continue until the end of the period.</li>
            <li>No partial refunds are issued for unused time within the monthly plan.</li>
            <li>For project work, only completed and delivered work will be invoiced, unless otherwise agreed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We also reserve the right to pause services if payment has not been received after the agreed terms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>8. Confidentiality &amp; Data Handling</h3>
          <p>All client information is handled with strict confidentiality. We take GDPR compliance seriously and will never share your data with third parties without your explicit consent.</p>
          <p>If we require access to your systems or software (e.g. Xero, QuickBooks, Sage), we will request the appropriate permissions and only use this access for agreed purposes.</p>
          <p>All documentation and files will be stored securely and can be returned to you at any time upon request.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>9. Scope of Work &amp; Liability</h3>
          <p>While we take every care to deliver accurate and timely work, HMJ Finance cannot be held liable for decisions made by the client based on financial reports, or for errors resulting from incomplete or inaccurate information provided by the client.</p>
          <p>We are not authorised to give regulated financial advice or act as tax agents on behalf of HMRC unless specifically engaged to do so.</p>
          <p>It is the responsibility of the client to ensure that all records, receipts, and documentation provided are accurate and submitted on time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>10. Fair Usage &amp; Collaboration</h3>
          <p>We aim to build open and collaborative relationships with every client. Our packages are designed for fair usage and regular communication. If your business or requirements change significantly, we’ll work with you to adapt your plan and pricing accordingly.</p>
          <p>We welcome questions, feedback, and suggestions to ensure you're getting the most from your service.</p>
